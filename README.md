--- Original Description ---
Satisfy your barbarian needs!

Just a small mod I made which allows you arrange fights between your prisoners. Spectators would be happy and get plenty of joy!

How does it work
You select two prisoners and start the fight from the arena spot menu. Any pawn capable of wardening will haul the fighters into the fighting area.

Fighters will automatically equip any weapon laying within arena radius

Build it from Misc -> Arena Spot

Should be compatible with practically anything.

Safe to add to existing colony. Before removing the mod make sure you don't have any arena spots on your map and your prisoners aren't fighting.
